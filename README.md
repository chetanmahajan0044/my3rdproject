Pishing website detection
The purpose of Phishing Domain Detection is detecting phishing domain names. 
Therefore, passive queries related to the domain name, 
which we want to classify as phishing or not, provide useful information to us.
It refers to luring techniques used by identity thieves to fish for personal information in a pond of unsuspecting internet users.
Phishers use spoofed e-mail, phishing software to steal personal information and financial account details such as usernames and passwords.
The malicious links within the body of the message are designed to make it appear which go to the spoofed organization using organizationâ€™s 
logos and other legitimate contents.
Our project deals with methods for detecting phishing web sites by Natural Language Processing and by Machine learning techniques.
